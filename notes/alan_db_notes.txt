* 3 relational rules:
      1) 1nf: all intersections of rows and columns are atomic
      2) 2nf: in 1nf and no partial key dependencies {A,B} → {C} but also {A} → {C} then {C} is partially functionally dependent on {A,B}.
      what not where rule: you cannot interact with a table in a positional way
      3) 3nf: all rows are unique
Goal is 3nf or bcnf

* 4 cardinalities:

create table emp(
    eid as primary key,
    fn,
    ln,
    dob
)

create table hobbies(
    hid as primary key,
    name,
    doc
)

create table eh(
    eid as foreign key, -- these two create a composite key
    hid as foreign key,
)

* weak entities and strong entities
must 'kill' children before we 'kill' parents
* delete cascade

* stored procedures
allow use to put logic in the database that is not of a declarative nature
